# Probabilistic Time Series Analysis

### Team members
	Yuqi Dai (yd735); Derek Yen (dy1078); Zihao Zhao (zz913)

### Dataset
- We plan to perform multiple model comparisons on an existing dataset. We will use the Rossmann Store Sales dataset from Kaggle, which has historical sales data from more than 1,000 stores in Europe.

### Problem
- Rossmann Company is Germany's second-largest drug store chain that operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. In this project, we aim to predict each storeâ€™s daily sales for a self-defined time period in advance. We will also have access to exogenous variables since sales are influenced by different factors including promotions, holidays, and seasonality. We will apply multiple models on the dataset, and compare their performance.

### Methods
- We are considering using a basic time-series method like ARIMA as the baseline. For our model comparison, we would like to try probabilistic methods such as hidden Markov models or Kalman filters as well as machine learning methods such as gradient boosting or RNNs. 

### Evaluation
- Root Mean Square Percentage Error
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error

### Task assignment plan
- Work together on EDA, Feature selection, engineering, and existing kernel review
- Each team member will implement and evaluate a different model
- Work together to finish the model comparison and final report
