# Probabilistic Time Series Analysis

### Team members
	Yuqi Dai (yd735); Derek Yen (dy1078); Zihao Zhao (zz913)

### Dataset
- We plan to perform multiple model comparisons on an existing dataset. We will use the Rossmann Store Sales dataset from Kaggle, which has historical sales data from more than 1,000 stores in Europe.

### Problem
- Rossmann Company is Germany's second-largest drug store chain which operates over 3,000 drug stores in seven European countries. In this project, we aim to predict each storeâ€™s daily sales for a self-defined time period of the final six weeks in the available training set data. We will also have access to exogenous variables since sales are influenced by different factors including promotions, holidays, and seasonality. We will apply multiple models on the dataset, and compare their performance.

### Methods
- We use a basic smoothing method as the baseline. For our model comparison, we try seasonal ARIMA, RNNs, and tree-based regression methods with time-based features. 

### Evaluation
- Root Mean Square Error
- Root Mean Square Percentage Error

### Task assignment plan
- Work together on EDA, feature selection, engineering, and review different options for modeling
- Each team member will implement and evaluate a different model
- Work together to finish the model comparison and final report
